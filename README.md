# YOLOv3 Object Detection Implementation

This repository contains a Python notebook implementing object detection using the YOLOv3 model (You Only Look Once). This project utilizes the YOLOv3 model from Darknet, available [here](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).

## Inspiration

Inspiration and guidance for this project were drawn from a comprehensive tutorial on deep learning-based object detection using YOLOv3 with OpenCV. The tutorial, available on [LearnOpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/), offers detailed insights into working with YOLOv3 and integrating it with OpenCV for object detection tasks.

## Prerequisites

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- [Darknet YOLOv3 model](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the YOLOv3 weights and Config from the [Darknet repository](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) or also found in this repository.
3. Edit video_path = 'CityScene.mp4' to match your own video.
4. Follow the comments in the notebook to understand and use object detection on your own video.

## Acknowledgments

- The YOLOv3 model and pre-trained weights were provided by [PJReddie's Darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).
- The project was inspired and guided by the tutorials and code examples from [LearnOpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/).
